# Find Your Pet 🐾

I designed the cover and login screens in Figma, while the interface design is entirely my own.

In this project, I created a platform where users can post and view listings for lost, found, or stolen pets. The application, built with React, allows users to add, update, delete, and list pet announcements. Each listing has a detail page with additional information such as phone number, email, and the owner’s notes.

I also integrated a map using Leaflet.js, which visualizes the location where the pet was last seen or found.

Through this project, I was able to strengthen my understanding of React’s core concepts while also bringing my own app idea to life.
